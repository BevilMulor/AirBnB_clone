<h1>AirBnB Clone Project</h1>

### DESCRIPTION
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! The goal of this project is to build a simple version of the AirBnB website, complete with a command interpreter, a website, a database, and an API.

### Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is the backbone of the project and is used for data manipulation and management. It provides a command-line interface for performing operations on data, such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects.

### Starting the Command Interpreter
To start the command interpreter, run the following command in your terminal:
'''bash
python3 console.py
'''

### Using the Command Interpreter
The command interpreter supports a number of commands, including:

create: Create a new object of a specified type
show: Show an object of a specified type and ID
all: Show all objects of a specified type
update: Update an object of a specified type and ID
destroy: Delete an object of a specified type and ID
quit: Exit the command interpreter

Here are some examples of using the command interpreter:

**Example:**
```bash
lenovo@ubuntu:~$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  create  help  quit

Undocumented commands:
======================
all  destroy  show  update

(hbnb) help quit
Quit command to exit the program
(hbnb) quit
lenovo@ubuntu:~$
```
